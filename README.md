# Projectile Motion

## Things in order to calculate
- Angle of launch
- Distance between camera and shooter
- Distance between camera and target
- Radius of sphere
- Radium of shooting wheel
- Momentum of the vehicle 
- Speed of shooting wheel
- Drag coefficient of sphere

$Leaving\:Speed = s\frac{m}{s}$
$Angle = \theta$
$X Distance\:to\:target = x$
$Y Height\:of\:target = y$
$Cam\:to\:target= h$
$a = -9.8\frac{m}{s}$

$V_x = s*\cos(\theta)$ 
$V_y = s*\sin(\theta)$
$x = h*\cos(\theta)$
$t = \frac{x}{V_x}$
$y = V_yt  + \frac{1}{2}at^2$
$y = s\sin(\theta)\frac{h\cos(\theta)}{s\cos(\theta)}  + \frac{1}{2}*-9.8*(\frac{h*\cos(\theta)}{s*\cos(\theta)})^2$
$y = h\sin(\theta)  + -4.9(\frac{h}{s})^2$
$y = h(\sin(\theta)  + -4.9\frac{h}{s^2})$
